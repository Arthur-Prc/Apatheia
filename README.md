Additional Recommendations:

**Data Encryption**: 
Use encryption on sensitive files and communications (especially on laptops or mobile devices).

**Remote Desktop Security**: 
If using remote desktop services, ensure secure VPN access and enable encryption.

**Password Rotation**: 
Periodically rotate passwords, especially for critical accounts and systems.

Additional Core Features for Enhanced Security:
**VPN (Virtual Private Network)**:
Use a trusted VPN service to secure remote connections and protect data in transit, especially on public networks.
Ensure the VPN is configured with strong encryption (AES-256) and DNS leak protection.

**Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA)**:
Implement a Zero Trust approach for network security, where access to resources is constantly verified and authenticated, even within the organizationâ€™s network.
Use Identity and Access Management (IAM) solutions like Okta to enforce the principle of least privilege and prevent unauthorized access.

**Cloud Security (CASB)**:
Integrate a Cloud Access Security Broker (CASB) (e.g., McAfee, Netskope) to monitor and secure cloud usage, especially for sensitive data in SaaS platforms.

**Pending updates:**
- Electron JS desktop app. (Add node_modules with .gitignore)
